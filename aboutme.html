											<h2>Current Roles</h2>

												<li> <strong>Student at Duke University</strong>, Junior studying Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science
											</ul>		
											

											<h3>My Background</h3>
											<p>As the son of immigrant parents, I am living the dream my parents and grandparents never had. Born on farms in rural China, my grandparents were expected to live their entire lives as farmers, living modestly and frugally to make ends meet. My parents were more or less the same - growing up having to work the farm or take up gigs to help put food on the table. Perhaps this would have been my future too, had my parents not made the decision to cross the Pacific for a chance at a new life. It was in New York that they found their footing, working 12 arduous hours daily earning minimum wage in order to afford the cost of living.</p>

											<p>My goal in life is to have a successful career and be able to support those around me. Academically, I have always been pushed to learn everything I can. I learned to ask questions to those more knowledgable than me, and to learn how to figure things out by myself. My parents have never pushed any career path on me, and as a child I longed to someday be a sucessful doctor. I enjoy using my abilities to help people and seeing their gratitude. However, I soon realized that healthcare was not for me. I knew that I could never control my emotions if I saw someone else in pain or suffering or if a patient died under my care.</p>

											<p>It was not until High School that I discovered my true interests. I will say that I have never been one for mathematical proofs or trying to visualize something that's intangible. Memorizing and trying to regurgitate geometry formulas and proofs? Boring. Having to measure and cut wood for a project but having to apply some geometry to get dimensions and angles right? That's more of my style. I have always enjoyed actually applying concepts learned in the classroom to real life as opposed to working out theoretical problems on a chalkboard. This is where I first realized that I liked engineering - being able to apply concepts in developing a real-life product.</p>

											<p>It was not until college that I decided the type of Engineering I wanted to pursue. </p>

											<p>I chose to come to Duke </p>
